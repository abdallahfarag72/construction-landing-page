# Construction Company Landing Page

This is a simple landing page for a construction company that I made as a task for the NTI web design course. It's built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a clean and responsive design.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdallahfarag72/construction-landing-page.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customization

- Modify `index.html` for content changes.
- Adjust styles in `styles.css` for appearance.
- Replace images in `images/` with your own.
